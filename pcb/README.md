# PCB Work

### Note - In general, all PCB designs that get fabbed should be uploaded here.

The current PCB design (1.1) is close to functional. It is very similar to 1.0, but with different 7-segment displays, plus a couple different parts. It is 127 mm x 127 mm. This is problematic in that board prices go way down when the dimensions hit 100 mm x 100 mm. It is also problematic in that the magneometer's pads are super close together, so minimum trace spacing has to be 5 mm, which makes the board more expensive. Also, cost aside, soldering this magnetomer is a pain and hard to do right. I (Dan) am currently working on a new PCB (let's call it 2.0) that will be smaller and will have a different magnetometer. It will also have battery discharge protection circuitry, and probably some other changes.
