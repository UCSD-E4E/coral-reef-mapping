### Code:
The code is organized as follows:
- All of our (programmable) devices are integrated along the I2C bus, so that is a central feature of all the code. 
- The code isn't super pretty. Issues are discussed below. 
- I'm not a CS student so please pardon any other issues you see. Stuff might be implemented in sub-optimal ways (things more important than just the naming), so don't be afraid to change stuff if you're good at microcontroller programming. 

#### Things to note: 
- For each device, there's a .h file declaring functions and some constants, and then a .c function implementing all of them.
- The function names aren't great; sorry about that. I'm a bit of a neat freak but never got around to organizing all the function and variable names to follow some nice rules. I would reccomend doing something like the following for naming functions: "device name in camelCase" + "\_" + "purpose of function in camelCase". I meant to do this but ran out of time. And of course, this is your project now and not mine so name your functions however you want.
- Depth sensor code - I don't think this code works, sorry about that. It's pretty close though, there's just some bug I didn't have time to catch because I can't test anything now that I'm not on campus. The depth sensor is interesting; you have to do some processing on the data that the device gives. The datasheet has some description of the processing that needs to happen, and an implementation is provided in code from Sparkfun. I copied this code and modified it just a tad to get rid of floats. Should work. 
- Speaking of floats - avoid them at all cost. The MSP (at least our MSP) isn't prepared to handle float operations (pretty sure it just doesn't have hardware for it so it has to do it in software, which ends up being pretty hefty) so they take up a lot of time and energy. Avoiding floats is totally doable, usually just by using large ints. The MSP compiler (Code Composer Studio) will get mad at you about floats as well as integer multiplication and division, but from what I gather, those aren't nearly as bad as float operations, so I wouldn't worry about those.
